- These algorithms can be used to organize complicated data and make it easier to use as well as to understand. Furthermore, having an understanding of these algorithms and how they work is fundamental for a strong understanding the *concepts of Computer Science*









# Need for this repository ? 
- This repository is meant to be a one destination for all a programmer to refer to all the DSA and Operating System codes
- This repository will contain the algorithms in C++ language.
- Intention is to create a unified all in one place for all the DSA and Operating System codes.

# How to contribute ü§î ?

1. Take a look at the existing Issues or create a new issue! 
2. Fork the Repo. Then, create a branch for any issue that you are working on. Finally, commit your work.
3. Before commiting make sure you are addding the algorithm in the correct folder. Incase a you are adding the algorithm in a new language make sure to create a new folder having the name of that language. 
4. Create a Pull Request (PR), which will be promptly reviewed and given suggestions for improvements by the community.



### ‚õî Points to be noted üìíüñä :
- Code must be in C++ 
- First valid pull request is accepted
